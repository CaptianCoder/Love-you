                <p>I feel like I’m living in a dream,<br>
                  You’re more calming than a beautiful stream.<br>
                  Your smile like a thousand sunsets,<br>
                  And you look like a dancing silhouette.<br><br>
                  
                  When we Dance and prance, the world seems to vanish,<br>
                  And My time with you always feels so lavish, <br>
                  Your laugh and giggle completely contagious,<br>
                  And you always seem to be so gracious.<br><br>
                  
                  Your touch brings out a million butterflies,<br>
                  And you’re more pretty than a thousand skies.<br>
                  I love it when we get to walk and talk,<br>
                  Thank you for entering my ever growing heart<br>  <br>

                <p>As we walk and talk, I begin to smile, <br>
                  Park in sight, and I feel like we’re in style.<br>
                  I look over and see big ol grin,<br>
                  The feeling of warm sunshine fills within.<br><br>
                  
                  As we approach, our walk turns into a run,<br>
                  We laugh and play, ive never had more fun.<br>
                  Tickling and joyous laughter fills the air,<br>
                  You smile and then I know we have something rare.<br><br>
                  
                  Then as you pull me in, all seems to fade,<br>
                  Staring in to your eyes you left me serenade.<br>
                  Your subtle lips, pressed against mine,<br>
                  A kiss so sweet, I never want to leave, it was truly divine.</p>

                  I can’t help but ponder, the beauty concealed;<br>
                  The temptation accepted, where might it have led.<br>
                  The curtains gaze has left me appealed.<br><br>
                  
                  As the curtains unveil my breath leaves me,<br>
                  Left wondering, how grace has fallen upon my soul.<br>
                  Your beauty surpasses that of a tranquil sea;<br>
                  The sight of you has left me feeling whole.<br><br>
                  
                  As my eyes fall upon you, I’m left enchanted,<br>
                  When you smiles, it leaves me a feeling of jubilee;<br>
                  I feel that all my wishes have been granted,<br>
                  Your happiness radiates felicity.<br><br>
                  
                  A thousand words can’t describe you well;<br>
                  But you are the prettiest of them all.</p>
